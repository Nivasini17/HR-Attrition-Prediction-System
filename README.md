💼 HR Attrition Prediction System
This project is an HR Attrition Prediction System designed to help organizations proactively identify employees who are likely to leave the company. Using a machine learning model trained on historical HR data, the system provides insights into employee attrition risk based on various features like job role, satisfaction level, work-life balance, and more.



🔍 Features
Predicts whether an employee is likely to leave (Yes/No).

Provides probability scores for attrition risk.

Interactive web interface using Flask (or Streamlit).

Visualizations of feature importance and employee metrics.

Easy integration with existing HR databases.


📊 Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: Decision Tree Classifier (can be swapped with Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Frontend: HTML/CSS (Jinja templates or Streamlit UI)

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Model Persistence: joblib or pickle.



📈 Dataset
The system uses a standard HR dataset which includes features such as:

Age

Job Role

Monthly Income

Job Satisfaction

Years at Company

Overtime

Work-Life Balance  etc.

The dataset is used for demonstration purposes and can be replaced with real organizational data.



🧠 Model
The current implementation uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on labeled HR data. You can easily switch to more complex models like:

Random Forest

XGBoost

Logistic Regression

Neural Networks


✅ Use Cases
HR Analytics Dashboards

Attrition Risk Monitoring

Workforce Planning

Employee Retention Strategies


📌 Future Improvements
Add authentication for HR users

Dashboard with filters and visual insights

Automated retraining pipeline

Deployment on cloud (Heroku, AWS, etc.)
